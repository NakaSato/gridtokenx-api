**Last Updated: November 17, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how GridTokenX ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our peer-to-peer energy trading platform (the "Platform").

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information you provide directly to us, information we collect automatically, and information we collect from other sources.

### 1.1. Information You Provide
*   **Account Information**: When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and password.
*   **Identity Verification Data**: To comply with legal requirements and for security purposes, we facilitate the collection of identity verification data. This process is managed by a secure third-party Identity Verification Service. The information collected by this service may include:
    *   A copy of your government-issued identification (e.g., passport, driver's license).
    *   Proof of address (e.g., utility bill).
    *   Biometric data, such as a selfie or liveness check.

    **Important**: GridTokenX **does not** receive or store copies of your documents or biometric data on its servers. We only receive and store the result of the verification (e.g., "verified" or "rejected"), a unique reference ID, and the date of the check.

### 1.2. Information We Collect Automatically
*   **Log and Usage Data**: We collect information about your use of the Platform, including IP address, browser type, operating system, and trading activity.

We use the information we collect for various purposes, including to:

*   Provide, maintain, and improve our Platform.

*   **Verify your identity** to comply with legal and regulatory obligations, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (CFT) requirements.
*   **Prevent fraud, abuse, and security incidents**, and to ensure the integrity of our Platform.
*   **Enable access to enhanced features**, such as higher trading limits and fund withdrawals, for verified users.

We implement and maintain reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Our third-party Identity Verification Service uses industry-standard security protocols to protect your sensitive data.

### 4.2. Retention
We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it. We retain your identity verification status for as long as you maintain an account with us and for a subsequent period as required by law for compliance and legal purposes.
