**Last Updated: November 17, 2025**

Welcome to GridTokenX. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the GridTokenX peer-to-peer energy trading platform, including our website, services, and applications (collectively, the "Platform").

By creating an account or using our Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

## 1. User Accounts and Eligibility

### 1.1. Account Creation
You must be at least 18 years old to create an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to keep your account information updated.

### 1.2. Identity Verification (KYC)
To ensure the integrity and security of the Platform and to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, GridTokenX requires users to undergo identity verification. We have established a tiered access system:

*   **Tier 1 (Basic Access)**: Requires email and phone number verification. This tier grants limited access to the Platform, including restricted trading volumes and no ability to withdraw funds.
*   **Tier 2 (Full Access)**: To gain full access to all Platform features, including unlimited trading, fund withdrawals, and participation in governance, you must complete our Know Your Customer (KYC) process.

### 1.3. Third-Party Verification Service
Our identity verification process is conducted by a specialized third-party service provider. By initiating the Tier 2 verification process, you agree to share your information with this provider for the sole purpose of identity verification, as further described in our Privacy Policy.

## 2. User Obligations

### 2.1. Compliance
You agree to use the Platform in compliance with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations.

### 2.2. Accurate Information
You are obligated to provide truthful, accurate, and complete information during the identity verification process. Providing false or misleading information is a material breach of these Terms.

### 2.3. Single Account
Each individual is permitted to hold only one verified Tier 2 account. GridTokenX reserves the right to suspend or terminate duplicate accounts.

## 3. Fees and Payments

### 3.1. Service Fees
GridTokenX may charge fees for certain services, including trading fees. All applicable fees will be disclosed to you prior to confirming a transaction.

### 3.2. Identity Verification Fee
To upgrade to a Tier 2 (Full Access) account, you will be required to pay a one-time, non-refundable fee. This fee covers the administrative costs associated with processing your identity verification via our third-party provider.

## 4. Account Suspension and Termination

GridTokenX reserves the right to suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to the Platform at our sole discretion, without prior notice, for reasons including, but not limited to:

*   A breach of these Terms.
*   Providing false, misleading, or incomplete information during the identity verification process.

## 5. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

The Platform is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. GridTokenX makes no warranties, express or implied, regarding the Platform's reliability, security, or performance. To the fullest extent permitted by law, GridTokenX shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues.

## 6. Consent to Electronic Disclosures

By agreeing to these Terms, you consent to the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information for the purpose of identity verification as described in our **Privacy Policy**.
